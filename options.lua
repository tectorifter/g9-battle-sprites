The sparkles are their own animation: each star blinks on and off on its own cycle, spread over the clearest, lightest facets. The whole crystal -- facets, bevels, rim and stars -- also rides the sprite's own animation, shifting with the creature's motion from frame to frame instead of staying nailed to the picture box.

The shadow is composited behind the sprite into EVERY frame of the animation, so it cannot flicker or desync from the frame clock, and it is drawn only in battle -- the Pokedex, the summary and the party list are untouched.

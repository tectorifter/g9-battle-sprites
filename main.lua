-- g9-battle-sprites -- true-colour animated battle sprites for the national dex
-- =============================================================================
--
-- WHAT IT DOES
--   Replaces the enemy front pic and the player back pic in battle -- and the
--   front pic on the Pokedex entry page -- with an animated, full-colour
--   sprite sheet from the DBK "solo sprites" pack
--   (la-base-de-sky / sprites-animados-dbk-solo-sprites, folders
--   Graphics/Pokemon/{Front, Front shiny, Back, Back shiny}).
--
--   The pack ships ONE png per Pokemon: a single horizontal strip whose frames
--   butt edge to edge, left to right, frame height == sheet height.  We use that
--   sheet DIRECTLY -- nothing is ever split into per-frame .png files on disk,
--   and no per-Pokemon subfolders are created (the pack is already one file per
--   Pokemon).  Frames are cropped out of the sheet in memory, each frame is
--   resampled once to the exact battle-pic box and cached as an Image.
--
-- LOOKUP (per battle pic)
--   1. national_dex species id (+ gender + shiny) -> a DBK sheet stem
--      (data/dbk_data.lua maps every species id to its stem; unknown forms fall
--      back to their base species).
--   2. <mod>/assets/<front|front_shiny|back|back_shiny>/<STEM>.png -- the mod's
--      own assets/ folder, and the ONLY source.  A sheet that is not installed
--      there simply leaves the vanilla pic untouched: there is no network
--      access and nothing is ever written.
--
-- FORM CONVENTIONS (the part that needed care)
--   * national_dex represents every mechanically/sprite-distinct form as its
--     own species id, and the map resolves each to the pack's own stem:
--       CHARIZARD_MEGA_X -> CHARIZARD_1     RAICHU_ALOLA    -> RAICHU_1
--       CHARIZARD_GMAX   -> CHARIZARD_3     SNEASEL_HISUI   -> SNEASEL_1
--       ALCREMIE_GMAX    -> ALCREMIE_63     MEOWSTIC_FEMALE -> MEOWSTIC_1
--       BASCULEGION_FEMALE -> BASCULEGION_1 OINKOLOGNE_FEMALE -> OINKOLOGNE_1
--   * cosmetic-only forms the pack has no sheet for (e.g. every Alcremie
--     flavour except base + gmax) are not mapped and fall back to the base
--     species sheet, which is the pack's own intent (base == ALCREMIE,
--     gmax == ALCREMIE_63).
--   * a Pokemon whose *gender* picks a different sheet (ABOMASNOW_female,
--     SNEASEL_1_female, ...) uses <stem>_female when the mon is female and the
--     pack has that file (data/dbk_data.lua's `female` set).
--   * shiny mons use the *_shiny folders.
--
-- PICTURE BOXES (why the frames are baked at these exact sizes)
--   Every frame is resampled ONCE into a canvas of the on-screen size the
--   vanilla pic occupies, so the engine's own placement math lands the sprite
--   exactly where the GB drew it and the pic scale can stay 1.
--     gen1 enemy front: 7x7 tiles at (96,0)          -> 56x56 at 1x
--     gen1 player back: pokered's 32x32 pic at 2x     -> 64x64 at 1x
--     gen2 enemy front: 7x7 tile box at (96,0)        -> 56x56 at 1x
--     gen2 player back: 6x6 tile box at (16,48)       -> 48x48 at 1x
--   (src/battle/BattleState.lua documents the gen1 back as "32x32 drawn at 2x";
--   src/ui/gen2/BattleState.lua documents the gen2 boxes.)
--
-- SIZES AND ALIGNMENT (the SPRITE SIZE / GROUND ANCHOR / FLOATERS options)
--   A sheet's pixels ARE the art's own resolution, so the way to keep the
--   image faithful is to spend as many of them on screen as the pic box can
--   hold.  MAX DETAIL (the default) therefore sizes each sheet on its own:
--   copied 1:1 when it already fits the box (a small Pokemon keeps every source
--   pixel), and shrunk only as far as it must be when it does not (a big
--   Pokemon fills the box instead of sitting at half size inside it).  Relative
--   size is still honoured for everything that fits; sheets taller than the box
--   all land on the box, which is as large as the screen can show them anyway.
--
--   The resample is ALWAYS nearest-neighbour, on a fractional grid: each
--   destination pixel takes the source pixel nearest its own centre, so hard
--   edges and the pack's exact palette survive.  (An area/box filter instead
--   blends neighbouring colours into new ones, which reads as a soft, muddy
--   smear beside the game's crisp pixel UI -- the earlier "blurry sprites"
--   complaint.)  A destination pixel whose nearest source pixel is transparent
--   borrows the nearest OPAQUE pixel it covers, so a one-pixel outline or
--   antenna is never punched out by the stride.
--
--   SMALL / NORMAL / BIG instead divide every sheet by one whole number (3 / 2
--   / 1), the old strictly-proportional behaviour, for anyone who prefers it.
--   A sheet too big to fit the box is always shrunk to fit, whatever the mode.
--
--
--   GROUND ANCHOR decides where each sprite sits vertically.
--   FEET (the default) anchors every sprite by its own FEET -- the bottom row
--   of its art -- so all grounded Pokemon stand on the SAME line however much
--   empty padding their sheet happens to carry; Zigzagoon and Wooloo, whose
--   sheets put their feet at different heights, now land their feet together.
--   It is a property of the ART, not of the pack's metrics, so it cannot drift
--   when a sheet and its metrics disagree.  A Pokemon the pack draws AIRBORNE
--   (see FLOATERS below) is instead lifted off that line by FLOAT_LIFT x its
--   own height -- a share of its size -- so a big flyer hovers higher than a
--   small one.
--   PACK uses the pack's own SpeciesMetrics data (data/dbk_metrics.lua,
--   FrontSprite/BackSprite x,y per stem): the pack anchors a sheet's UNTRIMMED
--   frame bottom-centre at a fixed base and shifts it by those values * 2
--   screen px.  We trim each sheet to its content first, so the padding the
--   metrics assume is gone and is put back with the same arithmetic
--   Essentials/DBK use; see setupFrames for the derivation.  BOX simply
--   bottom-centres every sprite in its box, with no alignment at all.
--
-- GIMMICK OVERLAYS (read live from the battle_forms mod)
--   Two optional, per-Pokemon overlays are baked INTO the frame rather than
--   drawn as a second pass, so neither costs anything per frame and neither can
--   desync from the sprite or flicker with the frame clock:
--     * TERA ART -- a Terastallized Pokemon wears a cut-crystal film tinted the
--       colour of its Tera type: a shattered pane of flat voronoi facets in a
--       chaotic mix of broad slabs and small chips -- the sites are scattered
--       freely, so no rows or columns of seams survive to read as a grid -- each
--       shard held inside a size band (chips are folded into their neighbours,
--       wide plates are split along a wavy fracture) and edged with fine dark
--       bevel seams, a chamfered rim, whole-facet specular glare and small
--       4-pointed star glints -- a solid white heart with four tapering arms
--       that soften into the facet, and nothing on the diagonals -- made only
--       of light, blended 70/30 over the sprite (the TERA TRANSPARENCY option
--       tunes the crystal's own opacity) and drawn ONLY where the
--       sprite's own pixels are opaque, so it follows the creature's real
--       silhouette instead of its square frame.
--     * DYNAMAX CLOUD -- a Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed Pokemon wears the pack's
--       red cloud above its head, like a crown.  In a fixed picture box the
--       cloud claims a band off the top and the sheet is fitted into the rest
--       (so the cloud floats clear of the head and only a sprite tall enough to
--       have used that room up is shrunk at all); in a custom screen's natural-
--       size mode the frame simply grows upward instead.
--   Both are read from battle_forms' own describe() payload and are absent
--   (no overlay, no error) when battle_forms is missing, older, or nothing is
--   transformed.
--
-- HOW IT HOOKS IN
--   gen1: wraps src.battle.BattleState:drawPicsLayer to hand each managed
--         battler its current frame as battler.sprite (the engine's own pic
--         draw path -- faint slides, send-out grow, squish/blink all keep
--         working), forces resolveBattleScale -> 1 for managed species, and
--         marks the drawn rect true-colour (PaletteFX.markTrueColor) so the
--         SGB/GBC zone pass leaves it alone.
--   gen2: wraps src.ui.gen2.BattleState:pic to return the current frame Image
--         with trueColor = true (Gold draws a trueColor pic raw), picScale -> 1
--         for managed species, and frontAnimFrame -> nil so Crystal's own
--         animated front pics never take precedence.
--   dex:  the Pokedex does NOT draw through either battle screen -- it asks
--         src.pokemon.Sprites.path / Sprites.pic for a front-pic PATH and loads
--         that file itself, so the pokemon.sprite hook (which can only swap the
--         path string) can never hand it our in-memory frame.  gen1's
--         src.ui.DexEntryMenu:draw and gen2's src.ui.gen2.PokedexMenu:picFor are
--         therefore wrapped directly to return the current frame with
--         trueColor = true (see the dex block below).  DEX SPRITES turns it off.
--         On gen1 this is also the national dex's OWN Pokedex screen: the
--         national_dex mod patches src.ui.DexEntryMenu in memory (its
--         src/dexpage.lua) into a page strip whose page 2 is its STATS page,
--         with LEFT/RIGHT browsing 326 alternate forms.  The sheet therefore
--         follows self.formId (the form the screen is showing, not just the
--         species the entry was opened for), is applied from BOTH the draw and
--         the update wrapper (national_dex draws its STATS page from its own
--         wrapper, which can return before the class draw runs), and a form
--         with no sheet falls back to the base species'.
--   summary: the party summary shows the FRONT sheet, on every screen that
--         paints one.  The party menu's STATS action opens it as the pushed
--         screen id "SummaryMenu" (src/ui/PartyMenu.lua), so BOTH generations'
--         native SummaryMenu are wrapped (gen1 self-draws the frame, gen2 wraps
--         drawPic), and a replacement registered under that same id -- or any
--         other pushed screen that paints the mon's own front pic, e.g. the g9
--         battle engine's 256x144 modern STATS screen -- is found by a
--         screen.pushed listener and decorated the same way.  A screen under
--         the party summary's id draws into the native 160x144 picture slot on
--         both its pages; anything else is treated as a wide modern screen
--         (left box, picture page only).  The mod never disables or reproduces
--         such a screen to show its sprites on it, so national_dex's own
--         summary stats box (which wraps the native draw) still composes
--         underneath.  SUMMARY SPRITES turns them off; SUMMARY SIZE scales the
--         picture on every one of them.
--   party: the little 16x16 icon on each PARTY-list row, on BOTH generations.
--         gen1's src.ui.PartyMenu.drawIcon (a module function) and gen2's
--         src.ui.gen2.PartyMenu:drawIcon are wrapped directly.  These icons are
--         the mod's OWN art rather than a user-supplied sheet: a separate
--         "icones animados" pack (one 128x64 two-frame PNG per icon) is packed
--         into assets/icons/party_icons.png, and data/icon_data.lua maps a
--         species id (and its female variant) to an atlas cell.  Each cell is
--         already the slot's exact 16x16, so an icon is drawn as a quad over
--         the shared atlas -- no per-mon bake, just the atlas decoded once.
--         gen1 marks the icon rect true-colour for the SGB/GBC zone pass; gen2
--         draws raw in GBC mode (the engine's own trueColor rule) and still
--         reproduces the held-item marker in the icon's bottom-left tile.
--         Species the icon pack has no entry for stay vanilla, and eggs get
--         the pack's own egg icon.  PARTY ICONS turns it off.
--   A core.update hook advances frame building on a strict per-frame time
--   budget, so image work never blocks a frame and no image work ever happens
--   inside a draw call.
--
-- SECURITY / SANDBOX NOTES
--   Needs only the "engine_internals" permission (it requires the BattleState
--   modules and PaletteFX).  It reads exclusively from its own assets/ folder:
--   no network access, no cache and no write of any kind.  It never touches
--   another mod, a playthrough save, or a host path.

    -- what matter: filling them in is what used to round the sparkle off into a
    -- white blob, and leaving them empty lets the facet show through the gaps

  -- DYNAMAX CLOUD (the red swirl above a Dynamaxed/Gigantamaxed Pokemon's head)
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- A Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed Pokemon wears the pack's own red cloud sprite
  -- above its head, like a crown.  It is baked INTO every frame (never a second
  -- draw pass), exactly like the Tera film and for the same reasons: it costs
  -- nothing per frame, cannot desync from -- or flicker with -- the frame clock,
  -- and follows the same nearest-neighbour resample as the sprite.
  --
  -- CLOUD_BAND is the share of the frame's height the cloud gets.  It is
  -- measured against the BOX in a fixed picture box (the cloud claims a band off
  -- the top and the sheet is fitted into the rest, so the cloud rides above the
  -- head and caps it without covering the face; a sprite short enough to already
  -- fit the remaining band is not shrunk at all) and against the SPRITE's own
  -- baked height in a custom screen's natural-size mode (whose canvas simply
  -- grows upward by the band, since there is no box to take it from).
  --
  -- The cloud is stored as one image with transparent margins; its content is
  -- measured once (loadCloud) and drawn anchored to the sprite's own content,
  -- so it sits over the head whatever the sheet's own padding happens to be.

  -- sinking the whole bounding box by a fixed share of its height would leave
  -- the MASS bottom (the part the eye actually reads as "the cloud") level with
  -- the head, opening a visible gap wherever the arched mass climbs away from
  -- the head's narrow top.  So the sink is derived from the asset's own mass
  -- profile instead: CLOUD_MASS_BOT is the row (as a share of the cloud's
  -- height, measured from its bottom) at which the mass thins into that tail,
  -- and CLOUD_OVERLAP is how many pixels PAST the head the mass bottom lands,
  -- i.e. the amount the puffs overlap what they rest on.  At least one pixel
  -- always sinks.  (CLOUD_MASS_BOT is from this asset; a replacement cloud

    --    trimmed pixels, folded only against b.maxH. This is what
    --    g9-Battle-Scene uses (see its drawSprite), so every species keeps
    --    the size its art gives it instead of being folded into a slot box.
    -- 0. An EXPLICIT field scale plus a BOX (b.scale + b.box, set by an older
    --    battle.mon_pic caller): every sheet is multiplied by exactly this
    --    factor, then folded to fit the box/headroom. Kept for any screen
    --    still asking for a box; g9-Battle-Scene now sends natural instead.
    -- 1. A custom battle screen's older UNIFORM divisor scale (b.divisor):
    --    every sheet baked at 1/divisor, the same whole-number step for both
    --    teams (kept for g2-Battle-Scene forks).
    -- 1b. b.fill: the boss's own slot asks a sheet to GROW past its native
    --    size to fill the box it was given. Ordinary slots never fill, so
    --    each species keeps its own relative size.
    -- 2. MAX DETAIL (mode 0): the largest scale that fits this sheet's own
    --    box, capped at 1:1 -- a sheet that already fits keeps every source
    --    pixel; one that does not is shrunk no further than it must be.
    -- 3. SMALL / NORMAL / BIG (modes 3 / 2 / 1): divide every sheet by one
    --    whole number, which keeps their relative sizes strictly
    --    proportional.
    -- 4. Modes 2/3 both fall back to fitting the box for a sheet they
    --    cannot fit, so nothing is ever clipped.
    --
    -- Per-axis fit bounds: the content may be as wide as the box and as tall
    -- as the box, but never taller than the headroom the battle screen

  -- borders and ONE uniform colour each, which is what reads as cut glass.

  -- their largest neighbour, oversized plates cracked along a wavy fracture --

  -- centroid, so the shard brightnesses ARE the pattern's lit-facet
  -- brightnesses (real relief, not a noise field), and neighbouring shards of
  -- similar brightness simply merge into one larger plane.
  --

  -- only turns the shared shard brightnesses into its own type-tinted colours,

  -- G9 party screen (opt-in -- the G9 PARTY SCREEN row)
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -- The party list drawn MODERN: the game's own 160x144 page, out of the game's
  -- own parts (its font, its HP-bar tiles, its cursor, its message box), laid
  -- out in exactly the native proportions -- on a 640x576 canvas, four times
  -- the Game Boy screen, so the pack's icon frames fit their slot at their
  -- natural size instead of being shrunk into 16x16.
  --
  -- WHY 4x.  The party list's icon slot is one 16x16 cell, and the pack's icon
  -- frames are 64x64, so four screen pixels per Game Boy pixel makes that slot
  -- exactly 64 screen pixels -- the frame's own size.  640x576 is also exactly
  -- the engine's own UI-surface ceiling (Renderer.MAX_UI_WIDTH/MAX_UI_HEIGHT,
  -- src/render/Renderer.lua), so no engine widening is needed; that is why the
  -- row is a fixed 4x rather than a free zoom.
  --
  -- HOW -- the menu's own draw, one scale transform larger.
  --   * gen 1: src/core/Game.lua asks the top state for the surface it wants
  --     (PartyMenu:uiSize -> Renderer:setUISize) and draws into it, so the menu
  --     asks for 640x576 and its native draw runs under scale(4,4).
  --     wantsFillScale makes that surface FILL the window instead of being
  --     integer-letterboxed down to 1x on a display that cannot hold it 2x
  --     (the same trade g9-Battle-Scene makes for its own surface).
  --   * gen 2: Game2 paints a `drawsWidescreen` screen's surround itself, so
  --     the same native drawPanel runs under a window-filling scale of the
  --     640x576 panel.  battlePanelScale answers the matching scale, which is
  --     what makes a classic screen pushed over the menu (a text box) cover the
  --     panel instead of floating small in the middle of it.
  --
  -- The ICONS come from assets/icons/party_icons_hd.png -- the pack's frames at
  -- natural 64x64, packed in the SAME order as the 16x16 atlas of PARTY ICONS,
  -- so the one data/icon_data.lua cell index addresses either.  They are drawn
  -- into the same 16x16 slot, where 16 design units x4 is 64 screen pixels --
  -- 1:1 with the art.  Every other part of the lookup (species/form/female/egg
  -- mapping, the frame clock, gen 2's held-item marker) is unchanged, and PARTY
  -- ICONS still governs whether the pack's art is used at all.
  --
  -- The ACTION LIST that opens when a Pokemon is chosen is the game's own: the
  -- native self.submenu/self.subItems state, drawn by the native drawPanel /
  -- drawSubmenu this wraps, so STATS / SWITCH / field moves / ITEM / CANCEL
  -- behave and read exactly as the game's own list does.
